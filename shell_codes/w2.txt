Encapsulation is combining code and data together
class is the one that doesnt exist physically,it is a template to create objects (class has no memory)
instances created from class i.e objects,objects exist physically 
everything is written inside classes 
Naming conventions-: 
java is third party language,hence follow standard naming conditions
for class name-: start with a capital letter/multiple words every first letter is capital 
for variables-: always in small letters (capital letter varibales are constant variables,example pi..etc Keyword is called final)
for methods-: start with small letter if its single word/if multiple words than starting from second word first letter is capital(camel case)
nature of variable (local and global but in java we dont have global instead we have instance and static)
instance variable-:variable declared inside class (they dont get the memory than and there itself,they get the memory when objects are created from that particular class)
you can have multiple instances for a class
static varibale(class level)-:this gets memory when we load the entire class into the memory  
                              you will use it by "classname.variablename"

returntype methodname(){
adjfjadsfdjf;
dkjbDKJFkdsjvb;
dkvbkjdvkbdjsv;
}

method prototype vs method signature 
call methods using dot operator on the object
methods-: 
    1)instance methods (there in class)
    2)static methods -: classname.methodname();can access only local and static variables cant access instance variables 

javac filename (on terminal) 
then byte code is created,this byte code is portable (created using class name)

Main method is called outside your code by jvm 
Absrtaction is achieved via access specifiers 

Input is supplied by -: 
1)CLI 
2)static 
3)dynamic 

String is a class in java  antha crazy 
JVM only recognises only .class files 

Its only one main method per class 
 
=>Object Creation process (Instantiation)-: 
classname refname=new classname(); (new is the Keyword) 
Step1-:each obj is created in heap memory 
if values are not specified for the objects then default values are set 
(NULL is default value for class type variables)  
Step2-:Replaced default values with actual values  
Step3-:Constructor will be called 
Step4-:Returns memory into reference 

=>Constructor-: 
its know as special method and lablled using class name 
with no return types 
purpose-: object state initialization 
"+" is the concatination operator when either of the operand is string  
Note-: there are local variables 
default values are only for instance variables 
java compiler writes the Constructor with no argument if the programmer doesnt make one 
super method call alway calls the super class constructor  
every class is by default Inheritanced from an ultimate super class called object class
