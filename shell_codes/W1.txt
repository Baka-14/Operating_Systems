c is procedural oriented language (since bottom to top approach)
small procedures to big approaches/interconnected/dependent on each other 

we have programs because of its computational power compared to the human mind 

OOPS is top to down approach (saves time & independency)
java or c++ object oriented language
python is multiple program paradim 

any entity in the real world is called an object 
objects are independent of each other 
any object has "ATTRIBUTES" and "BEHAVIOUR" i.e variables and methods

OOPS-: 
A. Encapsulation-:working on data and code/instructions together 
B. Absrtaction-:hiding the essential details and unhiding unessential detials (public,private,protected,deafault) 
C. Polymorphism-:one name acts as multiple forms based on user interaction(ex-:beverage machine)
D. Inheritance-:something that we derive from an existing one 

why java is so popular ? 
1. JAVA is simple (pointers /tough concepts are no there in java)
2. JAVA is distributed 
3. JAVA is robust (we have memory management by JVM & Exception handeling)
    JVM is present in every laptop 
4.JAVA is system platform independent/neutral architecture (creates byte code)
5.JAVA is portable 
6.JAVA is an interpreted language (compiler saves time but identification of error at which line is not done)
    Takes time but identification of error is easy 
    JVM -: compiler + interpreter 
    high performance 
7.JAVA is multi threaded/process
    thread is a procedure with performs certain tasks 
==> ENCAPSULATION-:
