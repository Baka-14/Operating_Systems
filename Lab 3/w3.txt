this refers to current class object (its a keyword) 

Abstraction-: unhiding the unessential details i.e limit the access 
i.e acces specifiers 
1.private-:only within the class is the scope
2.public-:anywhere everywhere 
3.protected 
the first three are keywords,the last one is default if there is no keyword 
4.default 
allows to access memebers across multiple classes within the same package 

the ac bc shows this in an example 

implictly understood that you are writing this line-: 
import java.lang.*;
# is the connector/script to bring the files from the shell;
likewise in java also 

packages have classes and classes have methods and methods have variables 
2 cases for proctected-: 

a.exactly same like default
b.acces across multiple classes across different packages 
if and only if the classes are in is-a relationship

is-a is generalization (inheritance)
has-a is an aggregation () 

how to create package-: it is created not in current folder but in some part of os 

javac -d is creating a directory 
. is the current location 
package should be first line of statement always else youll get an error


we are conecting objects  of diffrenent classes through constructers(explict inheritance) in subclass it will happen for super and subclass 
default can access varibales of only that particular package  

whenever class is public makesure your filename and public class name is same 
if the class is public you dont require is a relationship 

Encapsulation and Abstraction goes hane in hand 

any variable declared in smoe method scope they become local 
only instance variables get default values 

parse the integers its a method and we cant typecast since they aint in the same bucket 

static methods are called using class name 
instance methods are called using object name 

every datatype has its wrapper classes for its proctection 
any name is an identifier
basic rules of identifier-: 
length recommended to be less than 15 
predefined class names are allowed to be identifier 

There are 3 different data types-: 
1.Numeric interger type  byte short int long floating point float double
2.Char 
3.Boolean
